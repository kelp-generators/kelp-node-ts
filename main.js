        This function will get run when creating boilerplate code.
        You can use the above defined methods to generate code
        Here's a brief explanation of each:

        prompts: contains various prompt functions to get input frome the use
            {
                async prompt(question, defaultValue = '', validationRegEx = null, canBeEmpty = false, validatorFunction = null) => string // NOTE: The validatorFunction can be async
                async confirm(question) => true|false
                async numeral(question, validatorFunction) => number
                async toggle(question, option1, option2) => option1|option2
                async select(question, [...choices]) => choice
                async multiSelect(question, [...choices], min = 0, max = Infinity) => [...choices]
            }
        validationRegExes: contains various RegExes that are useful when dealing with prompts. As of now:
            {
                identifier: Allows a-z, A-Z, -, _, @, ~ and .
                license: Allows valid SPDX licenses, UNKNOWN and SEE LICENSE IN <file>
                repository: Allows github repos, eg. username/repo
                email: Allows valid emails,
                confirmation: Allows yes, no, y and n
                username: Allows typically valid usernames
                url: Allows urls with optional protocol
                phone: Allows international phone numbers
            }
        about: contains whatever the user specified using nautus me. NOTE: All fields can be empty
            {
                realName,
                githubUsername,
                name,
                gender,
                email
            }
        dir: path to the directory where the project files are saved
        cmd: function that allows you to run commands jsut like in a nautus script
            async cmd(command: string) => [exitCode, stdout]
        mergeScript: function that allows you to merge code into a script. NOTE: Don't include the boilerplate for a script, jsut include what needs to be put in the function
            // scriptName shall not include @ or .js
            mergeScript(scriptName, code) => void
        removeDefault: function that removes the default error from a script
            // scriptName shall not include @ or .js
            removeDefault(scriptName) => void
        chalk: chalk module to help you style your console.log's. See https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk for more
        fs: like the default fs module, but writeFile and writeFileSync are protected
            and ask user before overwriting existing files.
            NOTE: Usage of require('fs') is prohibited to protect the users data
